    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="about-me-info">
        <p>I'm Toyyib Olanite. I studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the University 
        of Lagos, but then, to satisfy my keen interest in computer science, I have taken (and I keep taking) 
        the initiative to develop myself in that field.</p>
        <p>I enjoy working collaboratively on really challenging problems in diverse and distributed ecosystems. Fields that I'm interested in include (but not exclusive to): 
          Distributed Applications, Databases, Design patterns, Blockchain Technology, Cloud computing,  Programming principles, Code management, 
          Scalability, security, Big data, Artificial Intelligence. I'm aware that this is quite broad, I have a lifetime to keep learning, so I am fine with it. We keep learning!</p>
        <p>I pick up new technologies fairly quickly and I am pretty comfortable decomposing technical problems into workable bits. These two qualities always come in handy! 
          Also, I have been informed, via various feedbacks, that I make a good 'client-facing role' guy. Finally, I should also inform you that there are two things I love almost much as Software Engineering: Music and Anime.</p>

    <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p class="skills-info">Typically, I am on the lookout for rapidly changing environments with dynamic objectives 
where I am required to continuously learn new stuff on the go. Besides, the software engineering space is constantly evolving, so I think
 being adaptive and introspective is key. 
I primarily code in Python and C++, pretty comfortable with MongoDB, Postgresql, Cassandra Databases and based on the aggregations of reultts of assessments 
I have recently taken, my skill set can be summarised as so: </p>

      In the fundraising economy, concerns regarding how funds raised are being utilised are continuously growing and to address that, we came up with BANQ, a decentralized donations bank for running 
      fundraisers. BANQ takes advantage of the Blockchain technology's security and transparency guarantees to enable secure transactions on the application via an EOSIO smart contract. I was primarily in charge of the smart contract 
      which was written in C++17. </p>

        an isolated human world. The Aztecs, as the people who lived there called
        themselves, quickly noticed that the aliens showed an extraordinary interest in a
        certain yellow metal. In fact, they never seemed to stop talking about it. The
        natives were not unfamiliar with gold – it was pretty and easy to work, so they
        used it to make jewellery and statues, and they occasionally used gold dust as a
        medium of exchange. But when an Aztec wanted to buy something, he generally
        paid in cocoa beans or bolts of cloth. The Spanish obsession with gold thus seemed
        inexplicable. What was so important about a metal that could not be eaten, drunk
        or woven, and was too soft to use for tools or weapons? When the natives</p>
